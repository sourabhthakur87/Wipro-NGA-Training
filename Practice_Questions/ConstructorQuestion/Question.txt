Implement a constructor in the Book class to initialize these properties.

Input Handling:

Use the Console.ReadLine() method to prompt the user to enter the book's title, author, and year.

Convert the user input for year to an integer using Convert.ToInt32() method.

Create an Instance of the Book Class:

Instantiate the Book class using the input provided by the user for title, author, and year.

Print Output:

Print out the values of the Title, Author, and Year properties of the created Book instance to the console.

Instructions:

Write the C# code for the Book class and the Main method as described above.

Ensure that the input prompts are clear and informative to guide the user.

Test your program by running it and providing different inputs to verify its functionality.

Document your code with appropriate comments to explain its purpose and functionality.
